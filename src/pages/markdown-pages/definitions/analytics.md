### What is Analytics

Analytics can be defined as the systematic computational analysis of data or statistics. Analytics is the science of arranging and interpreting data using computers to derive meaningful conclusions from raw data which can then be used to make informed decisions in a number of fields. Analytics are derived by applying statistics, computer programming, and operations research with the aim of quantifying and getting insights into the actual meanings of raw unsorted data.

### Why are Analytics needed?

We are producing data at tremendous rates. The data traffic on the internet currently is 35 petabytes every minute. All this data is important, but it doesn’t mean anything without being sorted and classified and that is where analytics come into play.

The greatest use of analytics is for marketing, especially internet marketing. Without analytics, marketing is just like pointing towards New York City and saying that the building is somewhere in that city, and analytics is the science that pinpoints the building among all the skyscrapers of the city. 
Making meaningful and informed marketing decisions without analytics is just next to impossible. You might get lucky with marketing without the intel from analytics, but that success won’t be consistent because you don’t know what made you successful in the first place. Analytics are needed to pinpoint the subjects of marketing so that the marketing strategy you make is effective and efficient.

However, marketing is not the only field where analytics are used. Analytics are also used by politicians to judge the political bias of a population and design their campaign in such a way as will maximize the possibility of success. 
Basically, every field where there are a lot of people involved and their age, political inclinations, buying preferences and choices are to be taken into account to make a good decision, analytics is the handiest tool that can be used to make sure things are going as planned and the efforts being done are pointed in the right direction. Before the era of analytics marketing and political campaigns used to be completely random and were pointed towards the entire population like newspaper ads and TV commercials. Now, the artificially intelligent systems work out the analytics which helps direct efforts in such a direction as is the most suitable and efficient.
