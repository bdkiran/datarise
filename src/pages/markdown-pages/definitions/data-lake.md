### What is a data lake?

A **data lake** is a system or [repository of data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_repository "Data repository") stored in its natural/raw format,[\[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake#cite_note-1) usually object [blobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object "Binary large object") or files. A data lake is usually a single store of all enterprise data including raw copies of source system data and transformed data used for tasks such as [reporting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_reporting "Data reporting"), [visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization "Data visualization"), [advanced analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analytics "Data analytics") and [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning"). A data lake can include [structured data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_data "Structured data") from [relational databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database "Relational database") (rows and columns), semi-structured data ([CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values "Comma-separated values"), logs, [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML "XML"), [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON "JSON")), [unstructured data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_data "Unstructured data") (emails, documents, PDFs) and [binary data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_data "Binary data") (images, [audio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_data "Audio data"), video). A data lake can be established "on premises" (within an organization's data centers) or "in the cloud" (using cloud services from vendors such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft).
