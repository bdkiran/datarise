## What is a Data Warehouse?

A data warehouse is a system used for data reporting and analysis. When used in an enterprise setting, it serves as a central repository for data across the organization.

Data warehouses differ from other central repository due to the state of the data. Typically, data in a data warehouse is structured and due to its origin, it has already been already cleaned. Data introduced to a data warehouse, generally exists in another data system, such as a [database](https://datareference.net/definition/database). Data warehouses are built using data from existing data systems using two main approaches, Extract, transform, load (ETL) and extract, load, transform (ELT).

## Why are Data Warehouses Needed?

Data warehouses are needed when organizations need to run analytical queries on business data collected. Data can be structured to better support these queries in this environment, as well as reduce load on the original databases that the data is sourced from.
