## What is a database?

A database is an organized collection of data. This data is typically stored electronically in a computer system. This data can be further accessed or interacted with using software referred to as a database management system (DBMS). The stored data and the DBMS, make up what is defined as a database.

There are different types of databases. Relational, document, graph and other database are used throughout the software industry. The decision to use one or the other is based on the objective of the application the data is needed for. Each have their own speciality, to solve specific problem.

## Why are databased needed?

Information that is needed to be stored is a common problem that occurs in almost every software use case. When compared to other types of storage such as using spreadsheets, databases offer key features such as: use by multiple concurrent users, ability to store large amounts of data, and ability to search or manipulate this data. When datasets grow large and application for this data is widespread, an implementation of a database is probably needed.
