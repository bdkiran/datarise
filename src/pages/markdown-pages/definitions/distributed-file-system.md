title: Distributed File System
---

A Distributed File System is a means of storing and securing the files based on a client or server architecture. In this system, the central server(s) reserve the files obtained with the absolute authorization rights, by all the remote clients.

## Development in DFS
In recent times, there's been a phenomenal growth in network-based computing.  There’s been a revolution with the client/server- based apps. Sharing “information” and “storage resources” on the network is among the primary elements in WANs (Wide Area Networks) and LANs (Local Area Networks). Various technologies are now developed to make this sharing more convenient. Distributed File System is one of the processes for it. 
Why do we need a Distributed File System?
DFS is quite advantageous in the way that it makes it easier to distribute the documents to many clients. It gives a centralized storage system and ensures that the client machines do not use the resources for storing files.

## Benefits of a DFS 
Some of the benefits of utilizing a distributed file system include: 
- A consistent and unified view of shared resources and folders
- Multi-user, remote/local file sharing
- Availability of data even upon failure of disk drive or the server
- Location independence and data access transparency
- File location transparency and efficient load balancing
- Reorganized load balancing & file location transparency
- Administrative flexibility and increased security
- Increased interoperability and stability

Some examples of distributed file systems include Netware, Hadoop(HDFS), CIFS/SMB and NFS are some examples of the Distributed File System. DFS is the emerging version of the file system that can handle information distributed across many clusters.
