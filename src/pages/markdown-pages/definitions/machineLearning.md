## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning refers to the study and creation of algorithms that improve with experience. Machine learning algorithms are an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

These machine learning algorithms are based off of mathematical models that are derived from observations or data. This is similar or an expansion of prediction models used in the vast field of computational statistics.

## Why is Machine Learning Used?

When used in business, the application of machine learning is referred to as predictive analysis. Machine learning's main application is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human assistance. This is especially useful for certain tasks like email filtering and computer vision labeling, as conventional algorithms do not provide great solutions in practice.
